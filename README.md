# Amazon-Alexa-Reviews
The sentiment analysis project focused on understanding how customers feel about products based on their online reviews. Essentially, we created a system that reads and interprets these reviews, categorizing them as positive, negative, or neutral. This helps businesses understand customer opinions and improve their products or services.
